# VBA_Challenge with Excel

## Overview of Project
The overview of the project is to help Steve analyze the green stock data for multiple stock market for years 2017 and 2018. Using the VBA application in Excel, our goal is to find the total daily volume and the annual result for each of stock, in this case 12.

### Purpose
The overall purpose of the project is to help Steve find an efficient way to analyze each stock market for years 2017 and 2018 based on the daily volume and results. After running the original script for each stock and year refactoring the code for a cleaner and simpler analysis was the best option. 

## Results
The results when we run the stock analysis for each year shows the yearly return in percentages based on the increase or decrease in price from the beginning of each year to the end of that same year. For each year the results show how much return you receive for each investment.

### The analysis is well described with screenshots and code

Based on the codes for each year, the screenshots prove how many times the code ran for each year.
